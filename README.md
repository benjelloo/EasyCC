# EasyCC

[NWHacks 2021 Honourable Mention üèÜ]

EasyCC is a easy-to-use Chrome extension that performs real-time captioning for your video calls or online classes. It is compatible with all video calling clients and softwares, such as Zoom, Discord, Google Meet, Skypem, and more!

As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to impact our lives, students are forced to stay at home and deal with the difficulties that come with online learning. 

Personally, we have struggled with connection issues, professors who speak unclearly, and noisy environments. We can only imagine what lectures are like for students who have a language barrier, struggle with hearing impairment, or do not have access to a quiet and comfortable learning environment.

For our hack we wanted to tackle this problem and create a tool that helps improve learning experiences and make classes more accessible for struggling students, with hopes of making a positive social impact by helping people communicate during a time filled with challenges and uncertainty.
